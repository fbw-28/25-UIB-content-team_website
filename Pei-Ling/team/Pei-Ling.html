    <p>I am Pei-Ling from Taiwan, been living in Berlin since year 2011. Riding a bicycle through the forests and near the water in Berlin or near Berlin is my favorite free-time activities (even though I haven't done a whole lot of it). I adopted a cat in summer 2015, through taking care of the cat I realized that we can learn a lot from house animals. They are so natural, not complicated, and positive. All they need is food, home, and love!</p>
